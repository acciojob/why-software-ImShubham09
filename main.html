	<h1> "Why I want to become a developer?"</h1>
     <p>Becoming a software developer is driven by my passion for solving problems and creating innovative solutions through technology. 
        I find great satisfaction in breaking down complex challenges into manageable pieces and crafting systems that improve people's lives.
        The ever-evolving nature of software development excites me, as it offers constant opportunities to learn new skills and stay ahead in 
        a dynamic field. Additionally, I am motivated by the chance to collaborate with others and contribute to impactful projects that 
        have the potential to shape the future. For me, software development is not just a career, but a platform to combine creativity, 
        logic, and technology to make a meaningful difference.</p>
